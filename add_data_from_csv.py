# Working with a csv file always has these parts:
#---------------------------------------------------
# A line (like line 7) to open the file that tells the computer which file 
# you want to open and some options to help it understand how that file is laid out.

# A line (like line 8) that tells Python how to save the info from the csv in its own
# language.

# A line (like line 9) that starts the for loop that will cycle through all the rows

Swamper is an application I am building to learn Flask. It mimics a blog format using the basic components in it:
	-Skeleton Flask files to launch an app (we began with "Hello, world!")
	-A models file that declares our classes (Post and User)
	-A forms file that defines forms for adding new users and adding new posts
